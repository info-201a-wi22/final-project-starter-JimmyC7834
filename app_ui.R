  p("For our project, we chose to discuss the issue of climate change by answering the question What causes and contributes to the climate crisis in the U.S?. This question will help us learn more about climate change, potentially its effects on the U.S. and further understand the root of the problem. To address this question we will analyze our data and get concise answers."),
  h2("Introduction"),
  p("Climate change is when changes occur in weather in a region or our global weather patterns, including changes in the amount of rain, temperature, sea levels, and extreme phenomena like heat waves, floods, and hurricanes. As our technology progresses along with society, human activities that cause damage to the natural environment have also increased greatly. Riding transportation, generating electricity, producing industrial products...etc. While these activities are all creating pollution to our planet in various ways, the common and most impactful source of pollution is the carbon dioxide emissions into the air. For our project, we would analyze and compare data about climate changes in every state in the U.S. through several visualizations to help us understand the development of climate change in the U.S., the causes, the victims, the risks, how they affect each other, and future changes we could potentially make to mitigate the risks."),
  h2("Design Situation"),
  h4("Project Framing:"),
  p("Project framing will be climate change in states and how it has changed over time. Climate change is a significant problem nowadays. It is not only happening in the U.S. but also happening in the global environment. However, in our project, we will put our focus on the U.S. to see how climate change has affected local residents. While there are multiple reasons why climate change is unstoppable, human activities are the main contributor to its development and we wish to spot the causes through data."),
  h4("Human Values:"),
  p("We will focus on how climate change might affect and cause consequences on humans and society, and reflect the relationship between humans and nature. Climate change is a complicated problem and all of us are involved in solving or contributing to it; people have different opinions and perspectives of the current environment which causes difficulties in solving the problem. For instance, many researchers and specialists believe electric cars will save the natural environment. On the contrary, some of them disagree with it due to several reasons. However, while human activities cause damage to nature, we would still need to balance human activities and the natural environment in order for society to progress."),
  h4("Direct Stakeholders:"),
  p("Journalists and researchers who refer to this project by analyzing and publishing articles related to it would be benefited. Politicians who change policies depending on this project would also be benefited from their new policies which might regulate human activities and seek balance among the natural environment, As politics is also a key to climate change and how politicians apply them to the natural environment."),
  h4("Harms:"),
  p("In the process of searching and analyzing, we might end up finding data that does not have a credible source. Our immature data analyzing skills might also conduct misinformation; we're still learning how we analyze the data and we still have different perspectives and biases on this topic. It may end up including incorrect information in this project and confuse people who review this project."),
  h4("Benefits:"),
  p("We would be able to understand what causes climate change and how it affects different states in the U.S. Also if those who read the articles get inspired by this project, they may change their attitude and opinions towards climate change which potentially pushes the progress of solving the problem of climate change. They might expand this topic and create a new discussion for climate change."),
