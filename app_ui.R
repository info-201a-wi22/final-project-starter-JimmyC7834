This question will help us learn more about climate change, potentially its effects on the U.S. and further understand the root of the problem. To address this question we will analyze our data and get concise answers."),
  h2("Introduction"),
  p("Climate change is when changes occur in weather in a region or our global weather patterns, including changes in the amount of rain, temperature, sea levels, and extreme phenomena like heat waves, floods, and hurricanes. As our technology progresses along with society, human activities that cause damage to the natural environment have also increased greatly. Riding transportation, generating electricity, producing industrial products...etc. While these activities are all creating pollution to our planet in various ways, the common and most impactful source of pollution is the carbon dioxide emissions into the air. For our project, we would analyze and compare data about climate changes in every state in the U.S. through several visualizations to help us understand the development of climate change in the U.S., the causes, the victims, the risks, how they affect each other, and future changes we could potentially make to mitigate the risks."),

  p("Project framing will be climate change in states and how it has changed over time. Climate change is a significant problem nowadays. It is not only happening in the U.S. but also happening in the global environment. However, in our project, we will put our focus on the U.S. to see how climate change has affected local residents. While there are multiple reasons why climate change is unstoppable, human activities are the main contributor to its development and we wish to spot the causes through data."),
  h4("Human Values:"),
  p("We will focus on how climate change might affect and cause consequences on humans and society, and reflect the relationship between humans and nature. Climate change is a complicated problem and all of us are involved in solving or contributing to it; people have different opinions and perspectives of the current environment which causes difficulties in solving the problem. For instance, many researchers and specialists believe electric cars will save the natural environment. On the contrary, some of them disagree with it due to several reasons. However, while human activities cause damage to nature, we would still need to balance human activities and the natural environment in order for society to progress."),

  p("Journalists and researchers who refer to this project by analyzing and publishing articles related to it would be benefited. Politicians who change policies depending on this project would also be benefited from their new policies which might regulate human activities and seek balance among the natural environment, As politics is also a key to climate change and how politicians apply them to the natural environment."),

It may end up including incorrect information in this project and confuse people who review this project."),
  h4("Benefits:"),
  p("We would be able to understand what causes climate change and how it affects different states in the U.S. Also if those who read the articles get inspired by this project, they may change their attitude and opinions towards climate change which potentially pushes the progress of solving the problem of climate change. They might expand this topic and create a new discussion for climate change."),

In the beginning around 1970, climate change has not been an issue as the chart indicates the frequency of disaster was not high. However, from 1990, climate change has been an issue in 1990 especially such as drought, flood and storm and climate change has been an issue nowadays."),

  p("After going through the two data sets we found and analyzing it using Rstudio and DataSpell, we have learned a lot about climate change in the United States. We have learned about the different disasters that are common in this country and how these disasters impacted the lives of people here.  Based on the dates from both our data, itâ€™s clear that our climate has been changing, there were less occurrences of storms and other disasters in the 1970s and the temperatures of states were different, but the issue has always been there. So, to answer our first question, climate change has always been an issue and it will continue to be an issue. Many different events and activities contribute to climate These activities endanger humans, animals, the water, etc. The people that are most vulnerable to climate change are those that live near area where disasters occur. These disasters have long lasting effects. They cause homelessness and economic problems. For example, from our data, we have learned that storms that have occurred between 1970 and 2021 have caused a total of 534132 homelessness. This is a large number, and it means that so many people have lost everything because of these disasters and because of our climate situation. The average temperature for each state has also been changing. The state that has the most intense climate is the state of Florida and its average temperature between 1995 and 2021 was 70.136. The state with the lowest climate or the lowest average temperature between 1995 and 2021 was North Dakota with an average temperature of 39.683."),
  h2("Discussion"),
  p("Our findings have helped us learn new facts about climate change. Before we started this project and before we started our research, we knew very little about climate change and we had a lot of assumptions but working on this project has changed our thinking. Using our two data sets, we have learned that the natural disasters that occur have serious consequences, even if itâ€™s just one. The death of innocent people is the biggest issue that comes after the disasters, but the problem does not stop with deaths. After the deaths, there are people that lose their jobs, their homes, and almost everything else. We have also learned about the effects these disasters and hot temperatures have on the animals and how they change the earth. All these findings are important because they help us understand that climate change is not something to be taken lightly. Itâ€™s a serious issue that needs all our attention. If we want to change our climate crisis, we need to make a lot of changes in our lives. There are changes that government institutions could make, there are changes that big companies could make, and there are changes we civilians could make."),
